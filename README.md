Users can view data such as repository information, stars, forks, followers, and more, all in one place. This project was built using React.js for the frontend, Node.js with Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage. It integrates with the GitHub API to fetch and display user data, helping developers better understand their GitHub presence.
